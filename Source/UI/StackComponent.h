/**
	This is a special UI container component, similar to a TabbedComponent.

	Components can be pushed on to (and popped from) the stack. The focus
	can be shifted to any component within the stack, or you can just let it
	automatically focus the head of the stack.

	It's been designed to be fully customisable in terms of how the content
	components are actually held and arranged. The default implementation
	simply fills the StackComponent with the currently focused content.
	By subclassing and overriding the virtual functions, it's possible
	to animate and arrange the content components in almost any manner
	desired.
